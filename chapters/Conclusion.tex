We have presented an algorithm and implementation to calculate the Lempel-Ziv factorization on the GPU.
Our algorithm requires O(n) work and O(time).
We show the usage of BLZ in the calculation of the LZ factorization.
Although this removed our ability to calculate the ideal LZ factorization that would be calculated in a traditional sequential algorithm, we found that using the BLZ found significant speedups on the GPU, incurring a space cost of at most .01 percent.
Using the BLZ, although not calculating the most space efficient ideal LZ factorization, could work well in a more practical environment.

We have also presented a reimplementaion and reevaluation of the GPU suffix array construction algorithm of Deo and Meely\cite{Deo}.
With the use of GPU libraries and parallel primitives, we were able to replicate their OpenCL results using CUDA on a NVIDIA GPU.
On files greater than 10 mb, we found at least a 3-4x speedup over the fastest CPU implementations.
This suffix array algorithm and implementation have many applications outside of data compression, most notably in bioinformatics.
