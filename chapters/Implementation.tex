\chapter{Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}
This section describes the implementation of the design discussed in Section~\ref{sec:design} built on top of the Wayland display server protocol. This implementation, called `Motorcar`, is free and open source and available on GitHub \cite{motorcar-github}. It is intended both to demonstrate concretely that such a design is practical to implement, as well as to serve as a functional 3D windowing system and provide a modular core of that can form the basis of further research into the concept of 3D windowing systems.

\section{Wayland Protocol Extensions}

The design outlined in Section~\ref{sec:design} requires several pieces of functionality not provided by the core Wayland protocol (like synchronization of the view and projection matrices between the compositor and the clients) and functionality that is not supported by the subsystems on which Wayland in built (like the ability for the compositor to access client depth buffers)
